### Bugfix - Error on login

On first login after registering, this error is thrown:
```
Call to a member function transactions() on null
```

### Feature - Notification when balance is low

When a user balance is low (< 10€), he should be notified by email.

### Feature - Recurring transfers

As a user, I want to be able to create recurring transfers.

I want to define : 
- A start date
- An end date
- A frequency in days
- An recipient email
- An amount
- A reason

Of course, I want to be able to delete a recurring transfer.

The transfer must be executed every X days (according to the periodicity defined by the user) at 2:00 a.m.
The transfer must also be executed immediately after its creation.

If the user has a balance lower than the amount, the transfer should fail and the user should be notified by email.

- A POST api endpoint to create recurring transfer
- A DELETE api endpoint to delete recurring transfer
- A GET api endpoint to list recurring transfer (with their status)
- Any kind of UI in the dashboard

### BONUS - Feature - Taking out a loan

As a user I can ask to take out a loan.

**The credit is granted automatically if the following conditions are met:**

0-200 € :
- If, over a 3-month period, the average account balance was above €100.

200-500 € :
- If, over a 3-month period, the average account balance was over €300;
- and the user has made at least 5 transfers over the same period.

500-1000 € :
- If over a 3-month period, the average account balance was above €500;
- and the user has made at least 1 transfer representing at least 50% of this average balance over the last six months.

Once the credit has been taken out, a recurring transfer (spread over 3 months) which the user cannot delete must be created, with a periodicity of 30 days.

### BONUS - Question

How can you ensure that recurring transfers are executed in the most optimal order?

In particular, when a user has several recurring transfers to be executed on the same day?

Example: at 2:00 AM my wallet is empty (0€), a debit (50€) is scheduled and an automatic transfer of 75€ from another user is also scheduled to be credited to the account.

How would you ensure that as many transactions as possible are successful?
